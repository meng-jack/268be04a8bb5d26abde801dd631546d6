# TODO

-   [x] Port over the fade in-out animation on the home page from the original Kobweb implementation
-   [ ] Add the Schema for this website following Schema.org specifications (as well as Google's documentation). The current one is copied over from the original website.
-   [x] Migrates `shared/strings.tsx` to be a JSON within `assets/strings.json` which will provide better ease of access
-   [x] Refactor all inline styles currently to use 'CSS-in-JS' as well as just normal CSS files in order to avoid potential overhead.
-   [x] Refactor all potential repetitive styles to use Styled-Components
-   [ ] Add proper side bar support for the admin-dashboard (the sidebar dashboard for md should use a floating button to open the main full size side bar as either a full overlay drawer or a side drawer. On desktop, the sidebar can be hidden to just icons or expanded. It is important, that the full size sidebar will be reused for mobile and desktop)
